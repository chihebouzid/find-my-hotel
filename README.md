:bulb: **Things I would do if I had more time:**

- [ ] **Add tests** : Add unit and e2e tests because any project is considered uncomplete without tests. I did not have the time to do this but next time I will use the TDD approach to avoid such issue.
- [ ] **Fix local storage issue** : current I save data fetched from the API in local storage to avoid multiple requests and to make the app a bit faster but if the user change his location the app will still show him old data from local storage. Should watch users position and update data in real time.
- [ ] **Improve form** : Use Angular reactive formand improve form validation and over all handeling.
